  --[ HOWTO CROSS-COMPILE ELINKS FOR WIN64 ]--

Hello All,

so it could be annoying to get elinks compiled
on Windows. Or Arm or just different architecture
than Linux.

if You'd like to do that there is a solution. And
that's mingw. You can cross-compile on Linux for
Windows etc.

Now I'll assume You'd want to compile Windows x64
binary on Linux. There is a script I provide. it's
build_win64.sh. It would create static binary for
Windows.

On Debian You'd use x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc or rather
the mingw toolchain. It's usage it's quite straight
forward just use it as environment variable:

  CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc

and to prepare the compilation configuration add:

  --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32

parameter to configure..

And that's it. With the script You'll get the very
basic binary for Windows. It could be run, it would
open simple http pages. The support for the terminal
is not very good. So I would advise You to use 
environment variable TERM and set it to dumb. Like this:

  set TERM=dumb

And that's it for today.
